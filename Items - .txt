1. Add a parser thing for battery consumption values - a) Battery for uploading/Downloading b) Battery for having one sample c) Battery for training one sample

2. Battery level for each client (Can pass through parser too?)

3. Have a system that stops everything about the client once battery <=0

4. Remove all attacker bullshit

5. Different chunks of data will work separately one after the other so that all data is not trained on at once

6. Should I make it so that the server chooses all the clients together?
